## Project Description
Movers is an android  moving app help app lets you compare local moving companies to find the best fit for you.
It is designed to help on scheduling and booking household moving and delivery. Users can get help with furniture delivery, large item moving, labor needs, and more from vetted, independent pickup truck owners.
The notable thing about Movers is that the quotes are guarantees; no estimates, just accurate quotes of the exact figure you can expect to pay your moving company.If youâ€™ve been burned by an inaccurate moving quote in the past, this guarantee should put your mind at ease for a less-stressful move.
