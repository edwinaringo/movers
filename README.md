## Project Description
Movers is an android  moving app help app lets you compare local moving companies to find the best fit for you.

It is designed to help on scheduling and booking household moving and delivery. Users can get help with furniture delivery, large item moving, labor needs, and more from vetted, independent pickup truck owners.

The notable thing about Movers is that the quotes are guarantees; no estimates, just accurate quotes of the exact figure you can expect to pay your moving company.If you‚Äôve been burned by an inaccurate moving quote in the past, this guarantee should put your mind at ease for a less-stressful move.

Customers enters their details and requirements.They choose their current location and final destination from map.Customer gets matched with helper.Alternatively they can select their own helpers.Full price is quoted to customer.Booking is the next step.If successful, customer and helpers/movers and talk and track goods in real time.Once all this steps are done,the customer can pay, tip and review
### 2. Movers  Class
